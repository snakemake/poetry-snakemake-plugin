# Make sure that all defined fields are 'Optional' and specify a default value
# of None or anything else that makes sense in your case.
# Note that we allow storage plugin settings to be tagged by the user. That means,
# that each of them can be specified multiple times (an implicit nargs=+), and
# the user can add a tag in front of each value (e.g. tagname1:value1 tagname2:value2).
# This way, a storage plugin can be used multiple times within a workflow with different
